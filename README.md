# Aviation Data Analysis

## Overview

With hundreds of thousands of flights every day, the aviation industry offers huge opportunities but carries significant risks. Understanding which aircraft types are safer can help companies make smarter, data-driven decisions. This project explores patterns in flight incidents to identify aircraft associated with lower risk and higher reliability.

Dataset

The dataset contains information on flight incidents, including:

- Event details (date, location, country)
- Aircraft information (make, model, number of engines, engine type)
- Flight purpose and registration
- Injury severity and aircraft damage

## Goals

- Analyze flight incidents to identify trends and risk factors
- Determine which aircraft types have lower incident rates
- Provide insights for data-driven decision-making in aviation

## Methods

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and summaries
- Risk assessment based on injury severity and aircraft damage
- Aggregation and comparison across aircraft makes and models
